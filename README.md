# Tetrist
This app is putting a fresh twist on the classic tetris game.

## [What is Tetris?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris)

Initial app was made following this [tutorial](https://github.com/MakeSchool-Tutorials/web-7-react-redux-tetris-app)

Any contributions or suggestions are appreciated.

### Future roadmap ideas: 
* making different display modes for the user to choose between (light mode, dark mode, different color palettes)
* adding another facet to the game where blocks can fall off the sides, making it more strategic with needing to balance the blocks.
